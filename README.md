## 🎓 What Is Onbogo?

Onbogo is a minimalist, beginner-friendly DeFi dApp built around one idea:

> *You learn best by observing others — especially the best.*

Here’s how it works:
1. 🚏 Hop on the bus by connecting your wallet.
2. 🎯 Enter a wallet address — this is your “professor,” someone you want to learn from.
3. 🔍 Review their recent swap transactions, pulled directly from the blockchain using the 1inch API.
4. ✅ Vote on which trade you think was best, based on price, gas usage, and token movement.
5. 🪙 Earn a token for voting — you’ll need it to vote again.
6. 🔁 Repeat to sharpen your skills, build your history, and shape the future of the game.

## 🧠 Why We Built This

We noticed how hard it is for new DeFi users to start: too many charts, tools, and decisions with too little context.  
So we built Onbogo as a soft landing.

Instead of placing trades, users vote on real ones. Instead of guessing, they learn from proven behavior.  
And instead of endless speculation, they become part of a playful, growing governance game.
