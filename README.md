# 🚌 Onbogo — Learn DeFi by Riding Along

Welcome aboard **Onbogo**, the DeFi school bus that picks up curious minds and drops them off at the doorstep of web3 confidence.

Built for beginners and designed by one, Onbogo is a lightweight, hands-on dApp that teaches the fundamentals of decentralized finance through real blockchain activity — no prior trading experience required.

## 🚌 What Is Onbogo?

**Onbogo** is a beginner-friendly DeFi app built around a simple principle:

> *You learn best by observing others — especially the best.*

Instead of placing trades, users analyze real ones. Instead of guessing, they vote and reflect.  
Onbogo brings learning and interaction together in a structured, playful format.

### What Users Do
1. Enter a wallet address — this is your “professor,” someone whose trades you want to learn from.  
2. Review real swaps made by that wallet (pulled via the 1inch API).  
3. Choose the trade you think was smartest — based on token pair, price, gas fee, and more.  
4. Vote and earn a $BUS token for participating.  
5. Track your voting history to see how your preferences evolve (e.g., do you favor low gas, high returns, certain tokens?).  
6. Repeat and learn — the more you observe, the sharper your instincts.

## 🚌 Why This Matters

DeFi is often overwhelming: complex tools, volatile charts, and a steep learning curve.  
Onbogo softens the landing:

- Hands-on, low-risk experience using real blockchain data  
- Voting as a learning mechanic, not speculation  
- No trading required — just observe, assess, and decide  
- Earn by engaging, not by risking funds  

By turning real trades into learning moments, Onbogo helps users build intuition and confidence.

## 🚌 How It's Made

This project is built with accessibility and simplicity in mind:

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite for fast development)  
- **Wallet connection:** RainbowKit + wagmi  
- **Smart Contract:** $BUS token deployed via Remix  
- **Blockchain data:** 1inch GetQuote, Swap, History, Token APIs  
- **UI Components:** Radix UI for accessible, consistent design  
- **Serverless API proxy:** Hosted on Vercel to handle CORS and secure external API keys  
- **Custom Ethereum address input** with validation  
- **Local storage** to track votes and user behavior  

The entire app — frontend and serverless functions — is deployed on Vercel.

## 🚌 A Personal Note

I built Onbogo as a beginner myself — learning by doing, stumbling, and making workarounds when needed.  
This project reflects that journey: it’s not perfect, but it’s real.

Similarly, users are encouraged to explore, experiment, and learn by trying. Grab wallet addresses from Etherscan. Compare gas fees in real time. Think critically about token swaps.

That’s what helped me, and that’s what Onbogo offers others starting out.
