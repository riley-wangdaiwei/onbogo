## 🎓 What Is Onbogo?

Onbogo is a minimalist, beginner-friendly DeFi dApp built around one idea:

> *You learn best by observing others — especially the best.*

Here’s how it works:
1. Hop on the bus by connecting your wallet.
2. See the current market quote and fees to learn about "Today's Traffic".
3. Enter a wallet address — this is your “professor,” someone you want to learn from.
4. Review their recent swap transactions, pulled directly from the blockchain using the 1inch API.
5. Vote on which trade you think was best, based on price, gas usage, and token movement.
6. Earn a token for voting — you’ll need it to vote again.
7. Repeat to sharpen your skills, build your history, and shape the future of the game.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I noticed how hard it is for new DeFi users to start: too many charts, tools, and decisions with too little context.  
So I built Onbogo as a soft landing.

Instead of placing trades, users vote on real ones. Instead of guessing, they learn from proven behavior.  
And instead of endless speculation, they become part of a playful, growing governance game.

## 🗳️ What’s Next

In future versions:
- Users will be able to nominate and follow verified “professors”
- Token holders will help govern which strategies or swaps are surfaced
- Voting power will shape the educational experience for new riders
